If you want to build a solid foundation for your understanding of the books you read, then you can't avoid some of the earliest plays, poems, and oral tales ever written down. Remember that the novel didn't really get popular until the 18th century, so you won't find novels on this list. Without reading the poetry of Homer or the plays of Sophocles, you won't be able to call yourself well-read. Here's a list to get you started:The Epic of Gilgamesh (Unknown author) (18th – 17th century BCE)The Iliad and The Odyssey by Homer (850–750 BCE, 8th century BCE)\"The Oresteia\" by Aeschylus (458 BCE)Oedipus the King by Sophocles (430 BCE)Medea by Euripides (431 BCE)Aeneid by Virgil (29–19 BCE)One Thousand and One Nights (Unknown author) (700–1500)Beowulf (Unknown author) (975-1025)The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu (11th century)The Divine Comedy by Dante (1265–1321)The Decameron by Boccaccio (1349–53)The Canterbury Tales by Chaucer (14th century);\n",
